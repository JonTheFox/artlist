# comments

Hi :)

This is my little comments page. It implements lazy-loading comments fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API, 
and presents them using infinite-scroll mechanism.

You might notice that the page looks a little bit different in small screens (mobile-size) compared to larger ones. The differences are subtle, but they are there:)

Feel free to clone this repo.
Then, all you need to do is run 

yarn && yarn serve

or

npm install && npm run serve

and voila!

Cheers,

Jonathan Weiss
