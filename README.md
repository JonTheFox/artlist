# comments

Hi :)

This is my little comments page. It implements lazy-loading comments fetched from the JSONPlaceholder and presents them using infinite-scroll mechanism.

You might notice that it looks a little different in small screens (mobile-size) and larger. The differences are subtle, but they are there:)

Feel free to clone this repo.
Then, all you need to do is: 

yarn install
yarn serve

and voila!

Cheers,

Jonathan Weiss
